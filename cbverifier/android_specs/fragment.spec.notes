Currently not handled:
starting fragment (we could write specs to say posting a transaction starts it but it will be a lot of work so this was overapproximated for now)

onActivityCreated only happens on fragment restart, but assuming this can happen non deterministically seems sufficient for now
to improve this make the rules conditional on wherever the restart occurs not having happened to that object.
