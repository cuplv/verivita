gathered from branch: "experiments_1" on github.com/cuplv/callback-verification 
file benchtools_setup/results/app_results.txt has the summary, produced by benchtools_setup/scripts/summarize_results.py which reads the output of extract_results.sh which uses benchtools with benchtools_setup/filters/ic3_filter.py
